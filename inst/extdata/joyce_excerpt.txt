There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. 
Night after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) 
and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night 
I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If 
he was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles 
on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set 
at the head of a corpse. He had often said to me: I am not long 
for this world, and I had thought his words idle.
